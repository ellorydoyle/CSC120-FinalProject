 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 -**My approach towards this project was to first make something I would want to expand even after graduation, but I needed to plan out all of the dialogue and the option choices before I even began to work on the coding**
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 -**I learned that constructors dont need to include all variables in the file, I learned how to randomize better, and how to do a scanner that encompasses all classes**
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 -**Yes, I wish I would have made it more of a map instead of just choices that lead you back to make the same choice**
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 -**Music and visuals, 100%**
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 -**You can keep your narrative, just give the player choices on who to talk to. Logan**
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 -**Start coding sooner, and make a map**
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
