For my game, I decided I wanted to do a narrative-based game, similar to the adventure game last semester, because I enjoy making things have a story behind them, instead of just walking around a map. During points of construction, I really questioned whether or not I wanted to make it a world I could walk around in on a map, but since I was working solo, I decided I needed to focus more on making the characters believable, and making the interactions randomize as much as possible, so every playthrough is different, and I think I succeeded in that. The number of choices you can make in the game are incredible, and all lead to different positive or negative outcomes, but sometimes I wish I had done more of a minigame approach, where I had people run around trying to accomplish tasks. I still opted for the narrative though, becuase I was working solo and I wanted the player to be invested in making the four possible outcomes happen on different turns.
