**OPTIONS**
I described this in my initial pitch for the game, but my game is much more narrative based than a standard adventure game, and so decisions that are made are on a specific timeline, and each of the options are explained as you are making them.
1. You choose your group
2. You choose how you are going to interact with the person guiding through the intro (+/- effect)
3. You have the choice to pick either Talk With a Glee Member or Sing A Song (9 times)
In Talk With a Glee Member:
1. You can be nice or mean (+/- effect, amount can depend on your group association)
In Sing A Song:
1. You can pick Broadway, Rock, or Pop (random effect, leaning positive chances)

-Each interaction you have is completely randomized in the main part of the game, so a name and an interaction is randomly picked seperate from each other, and the options are extremely varied. Each time you talk to a member, it randomly picks a group they are a part of, and that determines the interactions and names it chooses from.

**LAYOUT**
The game is broken up into three main sections.
1. There is an introduction where the player chooses their name, group they align themselves with, and then an example introduction to their group. There are three groups, cheerio, jock, and normie. Each begin with a base level desire for the glee club to succeed
2. There is the main gameplay that is broken up into three weeks, and each week gives the player three choices to make, and each choice has two options, either talking to a glee member, or singing a song
3. There is the Sectionals event, where the glee club either wins or loses Sectionals, and the player either wins or loses based on that outcome

**CHALLENGES**
In the game, the Glee Club either wins sectionals or they don't, but in order to win as a player, the glee club's outcome has to align with the player's level of desire for the glee club to win. For example, if the club wins Sectionals, but the player's wantToWin score is under 6, then they will feel disappointed they won. Another example is if the club loses Sectionals, and the player's wantToWin score is under 6, then the player wins the game, because they didn't really want the Glee Club to win.

Each interaction you have changes the scores for gleeOutcome and wantToWin, and since every interaction is completely random, sometimes making the same choices give slightly different outcomes, which makes the replay value higher.
